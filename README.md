## Abstract
**Background**: Physical distancing measures aim to reduce person-to-person contact, a key driver of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. In response to unprecedented restrictions on human contact during the COVID-19 pandemic, studies measured social contact patterns under the implementation of physical distancing measures. This rapid review synthesizes empirical data on the changing social contact patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

**Method**: We conducted a systematic review using PubMed, Medline, Embase, and Google Scholar following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We descriptively compared the distribution of contacts observed during the pandemic to pre-COVID data across countries to explore changes in contact patterns during physical distancing measures. 

**Results**: We identified 12 studies reporting social contact patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic. Eight studies were conducted in European countries and eleven collected data during the initial mitigation period in the spring of 2020 marked by government-declared lockdowns. Some studies collected additional data after relaxation of initial mitigation. Most study settings reported a mean of between 2-5 contacts per person per day, a substantial reduction compared to pre-COVID rates, which ranged from 7-26 contacts per day. This reduction was pronounced for contacts outside of the home. Consequently, levels of assortative mixing by age substantially declined. After relaxation of initial mitigation, mean contact rates increased but did not return to pre-COVID levels. Increases in contacts post-relaxation were driven by working-age adults. 

**Conclusion**: Information on changes in contact patterns during physical distancing measures can guide more realistic representations of contact patterns in mathematical models for SARS-CoV-2 transmission. 

*Changes in contact rates pre-COVID (dark blue), during initial mitigation measures in spring 2020 (black), 1-month post first relaxation of mitigation measures (gray) and 2+ months post first relaxation (light blue), stratified by age group. Estimates during COVID-19 were extracted from studies, estimates pre-COVID were either extracted from studies or from SOCRATES24. No initial mitigation data was available for South Africa. X-axis limits for Shanghai, Italy, Netherlands (Backer), Luxembourg and Greece were increased to capture larger pre-COVID contact rates.*
